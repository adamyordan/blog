This is a series of my project devlog to create a certain complex AI. In each devlog, I will write about my progress in developing and upgrading the complexity of the AI program from the previous version.
 Today&amp;rsquo;s Goal In this post, I will try to create a reflex agent with internal state in an imperfect information environment. The agent is a top-down shooter with a limited vision range, therefore it needs to store information about the map it already visited.</description>
