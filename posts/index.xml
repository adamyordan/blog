      <title>My Take on Chrome Sandbox Escape Exploit Chain</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamjordan.id/posts/006-chrome-sandbox-bypass/</link>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s Project Zero published a blog post explaining an exploit chain that bypass the Chrome browser sandbox. In this post, I will try to discuss my take on trying to understand the exploit chain. In summary, the sandbox bypass is made possible because of an Out-of-bound read and write bug in renderer process, chained with a Use-After-Free (UAF) bug in the browser processs, triggered via Mojo IPC connection.
As disclaimer, this is not a bug that I find, nor that this is a full writeup about the exploit.</description>

      <description>About HunterAI
This is a series of my project devlog to create a certain complex AI. In each devlog, I will write about my progress in developing and upgrading the complexity of the AI program from the previous version.
 Today&amp;rsquo;s Goal In this post, I will try to create a reflex agent with internal state in an imperfect information environment. The agent is a top-down shooter with a limited vision range, therefore it needs to store information about the map it already visited.</description>

      <description>About SecTips
This is a series in which I will write some tips related to security engineering. Instead of discussing heavy and long topics, I will present some fun things in a concise walkthrough format.
 Happy new year 2020! In this month&amp;rsquo;s SecTips, I will give some tips about how to create an unremovable file in UNIX, how to use AT for backdoor persistence, and how to listen to meterpreter with a laptop behind NAT.</description>

      <title>A Case Study on Jenkins RCE</title>
      <link>https://blog.adamjordan.id/posts/003-case-study-on-jenkins-rce/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.adamjordan.id/posts/003-case-study-on-jenkins-rce/</guid>
      <description>During my past experience assessing the security of Jenkins, I found several things I personally deemed interesting, such as how to craft RCE payload by analyzing patches and how critical the information a Jenkins instance possesses. In this post, I will walk through each step starting from initial information gathering to potential post-exploitation techniques in a Jenkins instance. I will discuss the thinking process and the possible damage impacted in case of compromise.</description>

 Today&amp;rsquo;s Goal In this post, I will try to create a 3D visualization using Unity and connect it to our agent written in python. You may want to read the previous post about Alexander AI concept because we will reuse a lot of the concepts.</description>
